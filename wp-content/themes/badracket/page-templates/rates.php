    <h2 class="bottom05">Mastering</h2>
    <p class="bottom05"><em>Will</em> we master your project? Yes.  It's $15 a song, and sounds pretty great.</p>
    <p>But we'll be straight with you: We're not a mastering studio.  You'll walk out the door with ready-to-share tracks, but they'll be even more awesome if you get a dedicated mastering engineer to massage your tracks one last time.  We know some people.  Ask us for a recommendation.

    <p>We love opening up our live room to freelance engineers, or a band who already has an engineer they like to work with.  Our freelance rates are totally fair. <a href="mailto:thomas@badracket.com?subject=I'd like to rent the studio, but I already have (or am) an engineer&amp;body=Describe what your project in as much detail as possible, and we'll be in touch.

    <ul class="top1">
      <li>
        <p class="bottom0"><strong>Do you offer time by the hour?</strong></p>
        <p>No, we don't.  What could you get done in an hour? Don't answer that... the answer is "not much".  Working in day-chunks is a more natural way to think of projects.  You'll see.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="bottom0"><strong>What do the rates include?</strong></p>
        <p>Pretty much everything.  Space, engineer, all of our gear, a Wendy's run, the beer fridge, and mixing. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="bottom0"><strong>Can you give me a custom quote?</strong></p>
        <p>Yea, we do it all the time.  Send us a <a href="mailto:thomas@badracket.com?subject=I'd like a custom quote&amp;body=Describe what your project in as much detail as possible, and we'll be in touch.  Thanks!">detailed email</a> about your project, and we'll give you a price.</p>
